DEMO RECORDING SCRIPT (3-5 minutes total)
==========================================

SEGMENT 1: INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
- Show the enhanced UI with all optimization panels
- Explain what we're about to demonstrate
- Point out the new "AI OPTIMIZATION" panel

SEGMENT 2: BASIC NAVIGATION (60 seconds)
- Start inference mode
- Show drone approaching goal
- Highlight the optimization path visualization
- Explain the color-coded path (red=poor reward, green=good reward)
- Show decision confidence levels

SEGMENT 3: OBSTACLE ENCOUNTER (60 seconds)
- Add obstacles or move to obstacle-rich area
- Show "OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE - Path replanning" decision
- Demonstrate how the path changes dynamically
- Explain the trade-off between speed and safety

SEGMENT 4: EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS (45 seconds)
- Show the energy penalty in action
- Demonstrate speed vs efficiency optimization
- Point out throttle usage in neural output summary
- Explain how the AI balances multiple objectives

SEGMENT 5: DECISION BREAKDOWN (45 seconds)
- Focus on the "AI OPTIMIZATION" panel
- Explain each field:
  * Decision: What the AI is currently optimizing
  * Confidence: How certain the AI is about its choice
  * Path Points: Historical decision tracking
  * Optimization: Current primary strategy
  * Neural Output: Raw network outputs

SEGMENT 6: CONCLUSION (30 seconds)
- Show successful goal reaching
- Summarize the optimization strategies demonstrated
- Show the full path taken
